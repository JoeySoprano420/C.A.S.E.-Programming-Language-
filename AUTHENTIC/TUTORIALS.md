## Tutorial 1: Hello World & Variables

**Goal:** Learn basic syntax and variable handling

### Step 1: Print Statements

```case
Print "Hello, C.A.S.E.!" [end]
Print "Welcome to programming!" [end]
```

### Step 2: Variables

```case
let message = "Hello, World!" [end]
Print message [end]

let number = 42 [end]
Print number [end]

let pi = 3.14159 [end]
Print pi [end]
```

### Step 3: Variable Operations

```case
let x = 10
let y = 5

let sum = x + y
Print sum [end]  # 15

let product = x * y
Print product [end]  # 50

let quotient = x / y
Print quotient [end]  # 2
```

### Challenge
