# ============================================================================
# C.A.S.E. SELF-HOSTED COMPILER
# ============================================================================

## Overview

This is a **self-hosted compiler** (also called a **bootstrap compiler** or **meta-circular compiler**) for the C.A.S.E. programming language, written entirely in C.A.S.E. itself!

### What is Self-Hosting?

A self-hosted compiler is a compiler that can compile its own source code. This is a significant milestone in programming language development because:

1. **Language Maturity** - It proves the language is powerful enough to write complex software
2. **Dogfooding** - The language developers use their own language, ensuring quality
3. **Independence** - The language no longer depends on another language for its compiler
4. **Meta-Circular** - The compiler understands and processes its own syntax

### The Bootstrap Process

```
Phase 0: Initial Compiler (C++ implementation)
    ↓
Phase 1: Self-Hosted Compiler v1.0 (written in C.A.S.E.)
    ↓ (compiled by Phase 0)
Phase 2: Self-Hosted Compiler v1.0 (compiled by Phase 1)
    ↓ (compiled by Phase 2 - now fully bootstrapped!)
Phase 3: Self-Hosted Compiler v2.0 (improvements)
```

## Architecture

The self-hosted compiler consists of four main modules:

### 1. **Lexer Module** (`lexer.case`)
- Tokenizes C.A.S.E. source code
- Recognizes all 98+ keywords
- Handles strings, numbers, operators, comments
- Tracks line and column numbers for error reporting
- **2,500+ lines of C.A.S.E. code**

**Key Functions:**
- `tokenize(source)` - Main tokenization function
- `nextToken(state)` - Get next token from input
- `lexIdentifier()`, `lexNumber()`, `lexString()` - Type-specific lexers
- `lexEndToken()` - Handle `[end]` terminators

### 2. **Parser Module** (`parser.case`)
- Builds Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from tokens
- Implements recursive descent parsing
- Handles all C.A.S.E. statements and expressions
- Provides error recovery
- **3,000+ lines of C.A.S.E. code**

**Key Functions:**
- `parse(tokens)` - Main parsing function
- `parseStatement()` - Parse individual statements
- `parseExpression()` - Parse expressions with precedence
- `parsePrint()`, `parseLet()`, `parseFunction()`, etc. - Statement parsers

### 3. **Code Generator Module** (`codegen.case`)
- Generates C++ code from AST
- Maps C.A.S.E. constructs to C++
- Handles indentation and formatting
- Optimizes output
- **1,500+ lines of C.A.S.E. code**

**Key Functions:**
- `generateCode(ast)` - Main code generation function
- `generateStatement()` - Generate C++ for statements
- `generateExpression()` - Generate C++ for expressions
- `emitHeaders()` - Generate C++ includes

### 4. **Main Driver** (`main.case`)
- Orchestrates compilation phases
- Handles file I/O
- Provides error reporting
- Supports command-line options
- **1,000+ lines of C.A.S.E. code**

**Key Functions:**
- `compile(inputFile, outputFile)` - Main compilation
- `compileLexing()` - Phase 1: Tokenization
- `compileParsing()` - Phase 2: Parsing
- `compileCodeGen()` - Phase 3: Code generation
- `compileCompiler()` - Bootstrap the compiler itself!

---

## Total Implementation

**~8,000 lines of C.A.S.E. code**

This demonstrates that C.A.S.E. is a fully-featured language capable of:
- Complex data structures (structs, enums)
- Recursive algorithms
- String manipulation
- File I/O
- Multiple modules
- Large-scale software development

---

## Usage

### Compile a C.A.S.E. Program

```bash
# Using the C++ transpiler to compile the self-hosted compiler
transpiler.exe self-hosted-compiler/main.case

# Run the self-hosted compiler
./program.exe input.case output.cpp
```

### Command-Line Options

```bash
# Show version
./compiler.case --version

# Show help
./compiler.case --help

# Run test compilation
./compiler.case --test

# Bootstrap (compile the compiler with itself!)
./compiler.case --bootstrap

# Show token stream
./compiler.case --tokens input.case output.cpp

# Show AST
./compiler.case --ast input.case output.cpp
```

---

## Example: Compiling Hello World

**Input** (`hello.case`):
```case
Print "Hello, World!" [end]
let x = 42 [end]
Print x [end]
```

**Compilation:**
```bash
./compiler.case hello.case hello.cpp
```

**Generated Output** (`hello.cpp`):
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    auto x = 42;
    std::cout << x << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Run:**
```bash
g++ hello.cpp -o hello
./hello
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, World!
42
```

---

## Bootstrap Process

The compiler can compile itself in a multi-stage process:

### Stage 1: Initial Compilation
```bash
# Compile the self-hosted compiler using the C++ transpiler
transpiler.exe main.case
# Output: program.exe (self-hosted compiler v1.0)
```

### Stage 2: Self-Compilation
```bash
# Use the self-hosted compiler to compile itself
./program.exe main.case main_v2.cpp
g++ main_v2.cpp -o compiler_v2.exe
# Output: compiler_v2.exe (compiled by itself!)
```

### Stage 3: Verification
```bash
# Compile again and compare outputs
./compiler_v2.exe main.case main_v3.cpp
diff main_v2.cpp main_v3.cpp
# If identical, bootstrap is successful!
```

## Comparison with C++ Transpiler

| Feature | C++ Transpiler | Self-Hosted Compiler |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Language** | C++ | C.A.S.E. |
| **Lines of Code** | ~4,200 | ~8,000 |
| **Compilation Speed** | Very Fast | Fast |
| **Maintenance** | Requires C++ knowledge | Uses C.A.S.E. itself |
| **Extensibility** | Requires C++ rebuild | Modify C.A.S.E. code |
| **Bootstrapped** | N/A | Yes! |

---

## Meta-Circular Properties

The self-hosted compiler demonstrates several meta-circular properties:

1. **Self-Understanding**: The compiler understands C.A.S.E. syntax because it's written in C.A.S.E.

2. **Self-Improvement**: Changes to the language can be tested by compiling the compiler with itself.

3. **Self-Verification**: The compiler's correctness is verified by successfully compiling itself.

4. **Language Evolution**: New features can be added and immediately used in the compiler itself.
